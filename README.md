This is a fork of the excellent [Bubo Reader](https://github.com/kevinfiol/rss-reader) by Kevin Fiol, which is itself a fork of the also excellent [Bubo Reader](https://github.com/georgemandis/bubo-rss) by George Mandis. On top of Kevin's technical changes, I've made further design and style changes to suit my page layout preferences, and a few other enhancements. Please see below for deployment instructions.

(I may post about this myself at some point)

Some changes I made:

* Many styling changes including three column grid for feeds
* The build script now optionally accepts feed names as defined on feeds.json and respects the sort order defined there
* build.js will calculate aritcle age
* Add a filter for article age
* "All Articles" view renamed to "all - firehose"
* build.js generates a feed group "all - by group" that is a set of all groups' feeds


## How to build

Node `>=18.x` required.
